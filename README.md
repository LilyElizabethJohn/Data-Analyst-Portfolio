## About Me

I am a Data Analyst with over 12 years of experience, specializing in data visualization, reporting automation, and dashboard development using SQL, Tableau and Power BI. My expertise lies in extracting actionable insights from large datasets to drive business intelligence, customer analytics, and KPI tracking across sales, marketing, and customer experience teams.

At Fusion Connect, I led the design and implementation of interactive dashboards, consolidated multi-source datasets, and developed performance metrics that improved decision-making and operational efficiency. I have hands-on experience in data wrangling, ETL processes, ad hoc analysis, and cross-functional collaboration to support executive stakeholders with clear, data-driven recommendations.

I bring a strong foundation in SQL querying, data storytelling, and business performance analysis, with a proven track record of enabling organizations to reduce churn, uncover upsell opportunities, and streamline workflows. I am continuously learning and adapting, committed to delivering data-driven strategies that support growth and improve customer outcomes.
